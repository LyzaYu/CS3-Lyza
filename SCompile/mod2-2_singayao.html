<h1> Your lie in April </h1>
<p> In a world of music, a discouraged pianist Arima was afraid to take piano back again, even with the support of his classmates, their support was simply not enough. It got worse when his mother and strict piano teacher died. This was the case until a violinist Kaori helps Arima overcome his trauma and depression by always being there for him and dueting with him. Little did he know that was his last performance with her. She had a fatal disease and went under surgery but tragically died whilst Arima played at a competition.</p>
